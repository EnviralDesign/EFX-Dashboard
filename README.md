## Installation & Usage

EFX Dashboard application at the moment requires a windows machine to run. It will not run well or at all on a VPS, as it needs some basic level of video drivers to work. This means intel integrated graphics, or nvidia/amd dedicated graphics etc.

### 1) Install TouchDesigner

EFX Dashboard is built with TouchDesigner, you'll need it to run the application.
